# Deep_learning_project_heart_disease
***This project was carried out in 2nd year of engineering (BAC+4) at ESILV for the Deep Learning exam.***

The objective of this project is to determine whether the patient presents a cardiac pathology according to his physical characteristics.

There is 40 datasets (with 216 rows) of heart disease information. The exam is split in two parts :

*   Modelization with a large dataset : Here we use 35 datasets for the training and 5 datasets for the validation.
*   Modelization with a small dataset : Here we use one dataset (the number 33) for the training and one dataset of 54 rows for the validation.
